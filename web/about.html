                            My name is Landon Jamieson. I am born in Edmonton,
                            Alberta, Canada. I lived in a small town very north
                            of Edmonton until I was 16 then I moved to Idaho
                            Falls.

                        <p class="flow-text">
                            I served my mission in the Pennsylvania Pittsburgh
                            Mission. I was able to serve from 2011 to 2013. I
                            was able to see a lot of success, help many people
                            and see much good done for the people of
                            Pennyslvania.

                            I worked for a year after my mission. Then in 2014,
                            I decided to attend school at Brigham Young
                            University - Idaho. I knew that I wanted to study
                            Computer Science since a conversation I had with a
                            missionary in Pennsylvania. I have learned C++,
                            Java, Javascript, Elisp, Python and others.

                            I am married to my lovely wife, Sadie. We were
                            married in the Rexburg Temple on 17 June 2016. She
                            is from Shelley, Idaho. She is currently Student
                            Teaching in Elementary Education and will graduate
